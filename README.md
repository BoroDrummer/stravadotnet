stravadotnet
============

Hopefully this small framework makes using the Strava API a little bit easier!

About this Readme
============

The last couple of weeks i focused on the framework itself, so i haven't had much time to write a Readme file.
In the Program.cs file, you will find a few samples on how to use the framework.
